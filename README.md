# WHY Q University Landing Pages

A modern, futuristic landing page project for WHY Q University built with Next.js 16, Tailwind CSS v4, and cutting-edge UI libraries.

- **Lead Capture System** with form validation and Pipedream webhook integration
- **Course-wise Fee Modal** displaying nested JSON fee structures
- **API Endpoints** returning JSON data for courses, fees, placements, and university info
- **Futuristic Design** with glassmorphism, neon accents, and smooth animations
- **Fully Responsive** optimized for mobile, tablet, and desktop
- **Accessibility** WCAG compliant with keyboard navigation and ARIA labels

> **Note**: This project implements two visual variants (LP1 and LP2) of landing pages for WHY Q University. Both pages showcase the same university with alternative layouts, section designs, and visual treatments to demonstrate different design approaches.
